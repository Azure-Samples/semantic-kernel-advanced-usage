Final Answer:
Based on the provided database context, the number of employees due a long service award in the next five years (assuming 20 years of service) is 262.

Assessment: The ground truth answer seems to be less accurate than the generated  answer as it does not consider the currently employed flag and therefore would incorrectly include past employees
