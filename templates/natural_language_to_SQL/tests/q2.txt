Final Answer:
Based on the given query and database context, we need to identify:

1. Male employees born between 1962 and 1970 with a hire date greater than 2001.
2. Female employees born between 1972 and 1975 with a hire date between 2001 and 2002.

The database context provides details about several employees. However, the context doesn't specify the gender of the employees. Assuming an understanding that
names like "Ken", "Randy", "Eric", "Sandeep", "Brian", "Sylvester", "Raymond", "Stuart", "Greg", "A. Scott", "Pat", "Gordon", "David", "Michael", "Shu", "José"
are typically male names, let's identify the relevant entries for the first condition:

Male employees born from 1962 to 1970 with a hire date greater than 2001:
- Ken Sánchez: BirthDate '1969-01-29', HireDate '2009-01-14'
- Randy Reeves: BirthDate '1970-04-28', HireDate '2010-02-23'
- Karan Khanna: BirthDate '1970-03-07', HireDate '2009-12-22'
- Eric Brown: BirthDate '1966-12-08', HireDate '2010-01-24'
- Sandeep Kaliyath: BirthDate '1970-12-03', HireDate '2010-01-17'
- Brian Richard Goldstein: BirthDate '1970-12-23', HireDate '2009-12-11'
- Sylvester Valdez: BirthDate '1970-11-12', HireDate '2009-12-11'
- Sootha T Charncherngkha: BirthDate '1966-12-05', HireDate '2010-02-23'
- Gordon L Hee: BirthDate '1966-11-29', HireDate '2010-01-11'
- Michael G Blythe: BirthDate '1968-12-25', HireDate '2011-05-31'
- Shu K Ito: BirthDate '1968-03-09', HireDate '2011-05-31'
- José Edvaldo Saraiva: BirthDate '1963-12-11', HireDate '2011-05-31'

Now, considering female names:
Assuming names like "Fukiko" (common Japanese female name) are typically female for condition two, the list is:
- There are no entries listed in the context with birth years 1972-1975 and hire dates between 2001-2002.

Therefore, the final answer would be:

**Male employees born from 1962 to 1970 with a hire date greater than 2001:**

1. Ken Sánchez, BirthDate: 1969-01-29, HireDate: 2009-01-14

3. Karan Khanna, BirthDate: 1970-03-07, HireDate: 2009-12-22
4. Eric Brown, BirthDate: 1966-12-08, HireDate: 2010-01-24
5. Sandeep Kaliyath, BirthDate: 1970-12-03, HireDate: 2010-01-17
6. Brian Richard Goldstein, BirthDate: 1970-12-23, HireDate: 2009-12-11
7. Sylvester Valdez, BirthDate: 1970-11-12, HireDate: 2009-12-11
